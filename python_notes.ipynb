    "You’ve made it to the end of this Python journey! That’s a huge achievement, and I’m super proud of you for sticking with it till the very end. Now, you've got all the basics and core concepts of Python under your belt. But remember, this is just the beginning. There’s a whole world of Python waiting for you to explore, and trust me, the more you dig, the more exciting it gets!\n",

    "And hey, just a quick secret, I learned Python in under a week! So, if I can do it, YOU CAN DO IT TOO! Everyone has 24 hours in a day. It's how you utilize that time that sets you apart from others. So, take what you’ve learned here, keep practicing, and you’ll be mastering Python before you know it!\n",
